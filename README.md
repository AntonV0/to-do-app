# Flexbox To-Do List
## Project #14 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
A basic, non-interactive to-do list for weekdays, with a separate container for reminders.

The purpose of this project is to make the to-do list responsive using flexbox properties.
## What I Learned
  - Flex and inline-flex displays
  - Flex properties such as flex-grow, flex-direction, and flex-wrap
  - justify-content and align items for container alignment
